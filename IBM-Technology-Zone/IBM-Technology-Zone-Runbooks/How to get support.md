## How do I get Support?

If you need IBM Technology Zone support, then the following four options are the best ways to get helpful information or contact support staff to help solve your problem.
1. You can find self help guides directly from IBM Technology Zone ["Help"](https://techzone.ibm.com/help) page
2. If you want to create a support case that will be sent to our support team, click on [Open a case](https://ibmsf.my.site.com/ibminternalproducts/s/createrecord/NewCase?language=en_US) and fill out the form. There is a guide for creating the support case [here](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/open_case_web_internal.md), but note that this is for IBMers only.
4. If you are not an IBMer you can also send an email to "techzone.help@ibm.com" to open a support case. 
5. There is also the ask for Help? button, which can be found from the resource/collection page by clicking on the Question Mark "?"
